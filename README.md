Testing the waters.
I hate to admit it but the waters are pretty cold.I expected them to be pleasantly warm but , on the contrary,they are ice-cold.Like tipping your toes into a lemonade or something like that.It would be greatly appreciated if someone could increase the temperature just a tad.All in all, I am immensely displeased with the situation.
